**Situation**
Ola, as a leading ride-hailing service, handles a vast amount of ride booking data daily. The challenge was to analyze this data to uncover trends, identify inefficiencies, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the overall service experience.

#### Task
As the data analyst on this project, my task was to:
1. Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
2. Perform in-depth analysis using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.
3. Create interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize the findings.
4. Provide actionable recommendations based on the data.
#### Action
Let me walk you through the steps I took to achieve these objectives:
  

1. **Data Preparation**
   - I started by cleaning the raw data in **MS Excel**, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency in formatting (e.g., dates, times, and currency).
   - This step was crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.

2. **Database Creation and Querying**
   - I created a MySQL database named `Ola_booking` and imported the cleaned dataset.
   - Using SQL, I wrote and executed queries to answer key business questions, such as:
     - **Total Rides and Revenue**: Identified that Ola completed **40.54K rides**, generating **22M in revenue**.
     - **Payment Methods**: Discovered that **cash** is the most preferred payment method among customers.
     - **Cancellations**: Found that **10.06% of rides were canceled by drivers**, while **17.79% were canceled by customers**.
     - **Top Vehicle Types**: Sedan and Bike emerged as the top vehicle types by ride distance.
     - **Customer Ratings**: The average customer rating across all rides was **2.48**.
     - **Peak Booking Hours**: Identified the busiest hours of the day for ride bookings.
     - **Top Customers**: Highlighted the top 5 loyal customers based on booking frequency.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - I created an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to visualize the insights. The dashboard includes:
     - **Ride Volume Over Time**: A line chart showing trends in ride bookings.
     - **Booking Status Breakdown**: A pie chart displaying the distribution of successful and canceled rides.
     - **Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance**: A bar chart highlighting the most used vehicle types.
     - **Cancellation Reasons**: A bar chart showing the primary reasons for ride cancellations.
     - **Revenue by Payment Method**: A pie chart illustrating revenue distribution across payment methods.
     - **Customer vs. Driver Ratings**: A scatter plot comparing customer and driver ratings.

#### Result
The analysis provided several actionable insights:
1. **Operational Efficiency**:
   - By identifying peak booking hours and days, Ola can optimize driver availability to meet demand.
   - Understanding cancellation reasons (e.g., driver unavailability, change of plans) can help reduce cancellations and improve customer satisfaction.

2. **Revenue Growth**:
   - The most profitable pickup-drop location pairs were identified, allowing Ola to focus on high-revenue routes.
   - Insights into payment methods can help Ola promote less popular methods (e.g., UPI, credit cards) to diversify revenue streams.

3. **Customer Experience**:
   - By analyzing customer ratings and feedback, Ola can address issues like driver behavior, vehicle conditions, and ride comfort.
   - Loyalty programs can be tailored for top customers to enhance retention.

4. **Driver Performance**:
   - Drivers with low ratings were identified, enabling targeted training programs to improve service quality.
   - Average turnaround times by vehicle type were calculated, helping optimize fleet management.

#### Key Metrics and Visuals
Here are some key metrics and visuals from the Power BI dashboard:
- **Total Rides**: 40.54K
- **Total Revenue**: 22M
- **Top Vehicle Types**: Sedan and Bike
- **Average Customer Rating**: 2.48
- **Cancellation Rates**: 10.06% (drivers), 17.79% (customers)

#### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:

 **Optimize Driver Allocation**: Focus on peak hours and high-demand areas to reduce wait times and cancellations.
 
 **Improve Customer Ratings**: Address common complaints (e.g., AC issues, driver behavior) to enhance customer satisfaction.
 
 **Promote Digital Payments**: Encourage the use of UPI and credit cards to reduce reliance on cash payments.
 
 **Reward Loyal Customers**: Implement loyalty programs for top customers to increase retention and repeat bookings.
 
 **Enhance Driver Training**: Provide targeted training for low-rated drivers to improve service quality.

#### Conclusion
This project has provided a comprehensive understanding of Ola's ride booking operations. The insights and recommendations derived from the data will help Ola optimize its services, improve customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth. Iâ€™m happy to answer any questions or provide further details on specific aspects of the analysis.

Thank you for your time and attention.
